# Engineering Standards & Design System

To maintain a premium, scalable codebase, all contributors must follow these standards.

## 1. Contribution Workflow

- **Branching:** Use `feat/`, `fix/`, or `docs/` prefixes.
- **Commits:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat(mobile): add map filtering`).
- **PRs:** Include a visual summary (GIF/Screenshot) for any UI changes.

## 2. Coding Standards

- **Atomic Components:** Keep UI elements small and reusable in `src/components`.
- **Logic Separation:** Business logic belongs in custom hooks (`src/hooks`), not in the render function.
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript models for all API responses and component props.
- **Styles:** Use **Tailwind (NativeWind)** design tokens. Avoid hardcoded hex values in components.

## 3. Design System (SSOT)

We practice a **Single Source of Truth** for our design tokens.

- **Tokens:** Defined in `src/styles/colors.ts`.
- **Sync:** Tokens from TypeScript are injected into `global.css` via Tailwind configuration.
- **Aesthetics:** Focus on **Glassmorphism** (translucent surfaces) and high-quality typography (Inter font).

## 4. Mobile Performance Best Practices

- **Asset Optimization:** Use `expo-image` for cached, smooth image loading.
- **GPU Rendering:** Always verify that complex layers (like maps) are GPU-accelerated.
- **Haptics:** Use `expo-haptics` to provide tactile feedback for primary user actions.

> Use `npm run format` and `npm run lint` regularly to ensure compliance with these standards.
